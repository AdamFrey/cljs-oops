```
Your boss: "Ship it!"
You: "Let me compile it with :advanced optimizations..."
Your boss: "Sounds good!"
...some time later
You: "Oops! It just broke! And I don't know why." 
Your boss: "Don't tell me that a random person on the Internet was wrong again."
You: (sad face) "Yep, they provided slightly outdated externs again."
```

'oops' is a ClojureScript micro-library providing macros for convenient Javascript object access. 
It stands for "object ops" and it is your externs killer.

To put it simple: oops is `aget` on steroids.
